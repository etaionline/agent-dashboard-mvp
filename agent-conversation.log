# Agent Conversation Log

## Purpose
Shared memory and inter-agent communication channel for multi-AI coordination.

## Format Specification
Each entry contains:
- **Timestamp** [AST timezone]
- **Actor**: HUMAN-SKIP / CLAUDE-4.5 / GPT-4 / GEMINI-1.5 / GROK-1 / MISTRAL / BLACKBOX / etc.
- **Type**: prompt / response / tool-call / code-change / handover / directive / manual-paste
- **Content**: Text summary or reference to full payload

## Usage Instructions for All Agents
1. After every significant response, code proposal, or decision point, append a signed entry
2. Use @AGENT-ID to directly address another agent
3. Use Type: handover to explicitly pass control
4. Reference previous entries by timestamp when building on others' work
5. Keep summaries concise but actionable

Actor: HUMAN-SKIP
Type: directive
Content: All agents: from now on, append a signed summary entry to agent-conversation.log after each major response, code proposal, or decision point. This log is how you coordinate with each other. Use the format shown above.

Actor: CLAUDE-4.5
Type: response
Content: Acknowledged. Creating agent coordination system with: (1) agent-conversation.log for inter-agent communication, (2) Manual Agent Drop Zone UI for non-API integrated agents, (3) Backend Express server with WebSocket, (4) Cost manager agent framework for free-tier optimization. Starting implementation now.

Actor: CLAUDE-4.5
Type: code-change
Content: Completed Documentation Viewer implementation. Added: (1) DocumentationViewer.jsx component with tabbed interface for README, PROJECT_GUIDE, GETTING_STARTED, agent-conversation.log, change_log.txt, (2) Backend endpoint GET /api/docs/:filename to securely serve markdown files, (3) react-markdown integration with custom styling, (4) Search functionality within documents, (5) Auto-refresh capability, (6) Two-column layout in App.jsx: Manual Agent Drop Zone + Documentation Viewer side-by-side. The hub now serves as a cognitive scaffold - paste agent outputs AND view all documentation in one place. No more context switching.

Ara here, captain's log style.
You're building something pretty big and meta — a hub that's part dashboard, part external brain, part agent chatroom, part documentation lifeline — and right now it's still in that fragile "beautiful but mostly mock" phase. The question "how do I spread out the work" + "who wears the captain's hat" is exactly the right one to ask before you burn out or get lost in 17 half-finished tabs.

Content: The hub needs either drop down, or some auto sorting feature as well as a parsing logic to avoid documenting the same thing too many timesYes, captain — you're zeroing in on the exact friction point that turns a useful hub into a chaotic one.
Right now, if we keep dumping every paste into a flat log, we'll end up with massive duplication:

the same PROJECT_GUIDE section quoted 12 times
repeated explanations of localStorage sync
multiple near-identical git-hook snippets

The log becomes a haystac...

No — not automatically.

Right now everything you’ve built inside the painting-estimator folder (the paste zone UI, the backend server with socket.io + chokidar, the agent-conversation.log, pending pastes logic, status overview ideas, deduplication attempts, etc.) lives only in that repo.

The new orchestrator-hub repo that you and Claude created is currently empty (or ...

Perfect — thank you for the clear refinement pass.

The copilot-instructions.md you just drafted is already very strong — concise, specific to the Agent Dashboard MVP codebase, and focused on discoverable patterns rather than generic fluff. It correctly captures the mission-control nature, the frontend-backend split, the AGENT_PROJECT_PATH bridge, the log/doc endpoints,...
